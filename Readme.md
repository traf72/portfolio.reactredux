## This is a simplified little part of a real project written on:

* ASP.NET Core 2
* Entity Framework Core
* React
* Redux
* Redux-saga
* Bootstrap 4

You can simply run this project from Visual Studio 2017 (you must have the [.NET Core SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) installed).
If you don't have Visual Studio 2017, you can run the `dotnet run` command from the ReactRedux.Web folder and then go to http://localhost:5000.

To run client tests execute the `npm test` command from the ReactRedux.Web\ClientApp folder.

All code from database to layout is written personally.
